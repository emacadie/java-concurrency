EnergySource.java uses Scala STM. See [the website here](http://nbronson.github.io/scala-stm/) and see [the Scaladoc here](http://nbronson.github.io/scala-stm/api/0.7/index.html#package). Before Scala used [Multiverse for STM](http://multiverse.codehaus.org/overview.html). Right now Scala STM is not being updated because the developers feel it does enough as it is. Multiverse seems dead, although for the most part it works pretty well. Teh developers of GPars have stated they might absorb it.
