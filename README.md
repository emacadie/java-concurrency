This project will have code for concurrency in Java and a few other JVM languages.   

I will do stuff in Java, Groovy, Clojure, and maybe Scala.   

Many examples from  Programming Concurrency on the JVM by Venkat Subramaniam    
In Venkat's book: up to page 173   
Going back and looking at STM again: up to page 134     
I seem to be spending a lot of time in this project and another project dealing with obsolete classes and packages and deprecated methods. In Akka. I thought Akka was a bit more stable.
