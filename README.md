This project will have code for concurrency in Java and a few other JVM languages.   

I will do stuff in Java, Groovy, Clojure, and maybe Scala.   

Many examples from  Programming Concurrency on the JVM by Venkat Subramaniam    
In Venkat's book: up to page 229   

I seem to be spending a lot of time in this project and another project dealing with obsolete classes and packages and deprecated methods. In Akka. I thought Akka was a bit more stable.    

2013-07-11: On page 196, I think I will skip the part about scheduling stuff for typed actors. I really want to get to GPars.
